  <p>Change is not comfortable for some, it can scare or confuse's and for various reasons the human sub-consciousness or consciousness could convince the mind to be affected in a negative way when confronted by it. For others, change can have the complete opposite reaction, it can inspire, motivate and excite to innovate, create, explore and so on.</p>

  <p>If we look at change within the evolution of technology and the critical role it has played to shape our very lives today, there is no doubt we need to respect its impact on our very existence in every way. I wrote this article because of the many people, blogs, articles, post... I have come across from time to time, one may say, the more technology we create, the more we need to create on top to manage/better it and maintain a sense of normality, while the process of integrations unfolds into our collective mainstream ecosystem.

  <h3> <i>why I believe in technology</i>:</h3>
    Very few people know why I got into technology, being from online broadcasting, CMS, monetisation, eWallets and now in the last 4 years virtual/augmented reality technology. When my company develops tech, I am kind of my own case study or inspiration in a way, due to my child, teenage and young adulthood experience's. I spent from the age of 5 to 13 yrs old in and out of hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (where I was born) had many surgical procedures, recall spending weeks or months in hospital or at home recovering, in bed, on couch, wheelchair, most times detached from normality when we think of a child's activities. I had many operations on my left ear, which is a long story why (possibly another article), yet after many operations the last marathon procedure resulted in a radical mastoidectomy, this obviously has left a permanent scare due to on going monitoring or maintenance requirements, which is not the point here. The point is, what I find amazing looking back to the late 70's and early 80's is how the tech of those times, literally saved my life, I ask myself "would I be here without that medical technology?"</p>
