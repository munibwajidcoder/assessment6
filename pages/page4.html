    <p>My company obviously see's VR/AR/MR/AI/Robitics as a stepping stone towards a new way of a collective mass being i.e much more social, protected, professional, aware, included, experienced, connected, productive, educated, informed, entertained, affiliated, promoted, archived etc... a way to live or re-live moments or content as if there in person is already a market we need to consider and in progress. For example, in the 1990's if you didn't have a website, you where not considered professional, in the 2000's if you didn't have a website & app, you where not considered professional and in the 2017's if you don't have a website + app + 3D VR experience, you will not be considered professional and it will follow with A.I, AR, MR, Robotics etc.... on a business level as the bar gets raised on what it means to be professional, could ultimately determine if your target audience, fans, clients, partners, students etc... stay with you or move towards others that offer the new standard and convenience. Therefore staying innovative and current is critical to good business practice, even more so as technology keeps advancing at the rate we are currently witnessing, my tip is always avoid falling behind at every turn.</p>
    <p>Imagine a future world that can allow the human being to have less negative emotional or phycological distractions and apply focus on inner growth, possibly trigger the evolution of more brain power due to less distractions. If we plan it right, its not that humans will not become useless due to technology advancements, removing negative emotional or psychological barriers, in return could allow our consciousness to become even more intellectually advanced, another way of looking at it. This can be due to free time to explore ourselves in more depth than ever before, isn't that what technology should do, offer a convenience to have more time for ones self growth or being? Some very educated and talented people have shared and discussed this topic to me over the years, all I know is when I tune out negative energies, my state of mind is more open, productive, stress free, understanding etc....

        Imagine we can design a better system all together, a way to reduce working hours and increase personal time, eliminate illness, suffering, poverty, hunger, war etc... unite as a community who research, discuss and decide the best ways to demonstrate a better option to the powers at be, gain their attention, support and actions e.g build a system that doesn't reward contribution with a salary, rather with a better life plan.</p>
