      <p>Imagine a future world that can allow the human being to have less negative emotional or phycological distractions and apply focus on inner growth, possibly trigger the evolution of more brain power due to less distractions. If we plan it right, its not that humans will not become useless due to technology advancements, removing negative emotional or psychological barriers, in return could allow our consciousness to become even more intellectually advanced, another way of looking at it. This can be due to free time to explore ourselves in more depth than ever before, isn't that what technology should do, offer a convenience to have more time for ones self growth or being? Some very educated and talented people have shared and discussed this topic to me over the years, all I know is when I tune out negative energies, my state of mind is more open, productive, stress free, understanding etc....  <br>Imagine we can design a better system all together, a way to reduce working hours and increase personal time, eliminate illness, suffering, poverty, hunger, war etc... unite as a community who research, discuss and decide the best ways to demonstrate a better option to the powers at be, gain their attention, support and actions e.g build a system that doesn't reward contribution with a salary, rather with a better life plan.

      <p> once begun to build a concept of the perfect system i.e how do we remove the traditional salary system and change it for a better reward system, could we make education free for all, housing and food available for all, less working hours/days/months i.e something robotics can allow us to aim for etc... and you know what, my answer is YES, it is possible, but without building a small community that is willing to discover and test the system, it would be impossible to demonstrates it's potential, what if we gained enough support to make that happen? e.g eventually design, build and demonstrate a better system via a small community of 10,000, leading the way for a new type of communal existence, without removing the desire to contribute or risk of becoming useless, rather the opposite. I started planning of such a project, but once again, I am one person, need to work, run a company and can't address all the expertise or hours required to make it happen realistically, however, together we have a chance.</p>

      <h3><i>Conclusion:</i></h3>
      <p>YES, I am a dreamer and believe without dreams this world would never change, I launched my company to offer solutions, which is just the start for me and I see many start ups, founders, entrepreneurs, visionaries, professionals etc... doing the same. I have so many connections in my network, on many platforms and wanted to clarify that sometimes, what we do in life, is due to what life has done to us. As individuals we decide to share that experience in a positive or negative action, no one else, yes, everyone will make mistakes, its learning from them that matters. We could all feel sorry for ourselves, give up, not try to better a situation etc..... but let me say that our true purpose as beings is to learn, grow and make a positive contribution to our time's and future generation to come. Don't you agree?</p>
