    <p>So, the positive side of this experience is obviously a dedicated doctor, who studied all his life in order to save lives, embraced new technologies of his time and YES, saved me, which I am thankful for everyday and has inspired me in my professional life! The other side of this experience is the negative impact I recall e.g long hours in bed, siblings or childhood friends I missed being or playing with or life moment's that passed, hearing about what was happening in the outside world, waiting for my family to visit, not being able to swim under water for many years etc... I also could see early social insecurities or confidence issues as a result to this experience, which lead to being easily influenced or bad judgment for a period. Turning this negative to a positive, by experiencing the impact of tech, I got inspired to develop technology that never existed in my time for example, the mobile phone became a commercial product in the mid 80's and mainstream by the 90's, they weren't even close to the mobiles devices we have today. Social Networking became mainstream by the late 90's, changing our lives forever and computing hardware/platforms are now a standard requirement in every house hold, work place or institution. Kids of today can't even imagine life without the available technology/services, just like my generation which was born with a TV from day one, whereas our parents didn't grow up with one at all, today every bedroom has a TV or mobile device with broadcasting capabilities and technology integrated, you get my point. I constantly wonder, only if I had live streaming, social chat, online broadcasting, virtual reality in my child, teenage, young adulthood, maybe could of had a sense of normality, relief, success etc... or how many others are in my shoes, restricted to circumstances?</p>

    <p>Automation, Robotics, AI, VR, AR, MR, iOT, Biometrics, BlockChain, Bitcoin etc... is a change that scares many, for example when robots are smarter than us, I hear, what will happen to our jobs? and in fairness it's a good question that needs consideration and planning as a global community. Managed & self-managed AI robot's are coming, what we need to determine is how we let them in, stating the obvious. What I normally do is ask standard questions, i.e: in Robotics case</p>
