    <p>Some times looking in the past, helps us understand 'how we should try and change our future' what can we improve in todays mainstream tech ecosystem to evolve and also benefit our very existence for the better? We are currently in another great technological transition, the kids of today will not only witness it's integration but be affected by its future outcome. So that tells me, we need to plan carefully, lets face it, todays system which we inherited is not exactly perfect, one can see the waste and damage in produce, energy, water, oil, polution etc... with a commercial impact and an obvious class divide due to poverty, suffering, health issues etc.. is that real progress? or as I see it, are we just getting through, day by day, year by year, until an epidemic or war forces an unwanted or non calculated change in time. As an advanced civilisation, we should be planning this current transition in a way never done before, avoid the mistakes of the past, God knows we have the technology to do just that now, let alone what will be possible in the next 5 years or so 
<br>
My real point of this article is, I want to invite like minded people into something a little more than just a Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc... network, why don't we try build a community that has a sole focus to plan the best way to change the future with technology, the RIGHT way, for the greater good. YES, I know there are many groups or movements already looking to change the world and the overall system we live in, but few that actually follow through. United we have a louder voice, old cliche, but very true, currently the technology sector is progressing in many directions, everyone is in heavy R & D and no real collective voice is helping drive the right change technology can offer. Can't we use the same network technology that binds us together on these networks, towards a dedicated network that solely has open discussions, expert opinions, consultations and a collective influence to make the right change for our future advances?

    <p>Everyone will go to do business as usual after reading this, no doubt, some will appreciate it, some won't, some will understand my reason for writing it, some will judge it in the wrong light, its human nature to have an opinion on everything we come across and that is perfectly fine in my book, thats how we got here and will keep getting ahead right. progress. For example, in the 1990's if you didn't have a website, you where not considered professional, in the 2000's if you didn't have a website & app, you where not considered professional and in the 2017's if you don't have a website + app + 3D VR experience, you will not be considered professional and it will follow with A.I, AR, MR, Robotics etc.... on a business level as the bar gets raised on what it means to be professional, could ultimately determine if your target audience, fans, clients, partners, students etc... stay with you or move towards others that offer the new standard and convenience. Therefore staying innovative and current is critical to good business practice, even more so as technology keeps advancing at the rate we are currently witnessing, my tip is always avoid falling behind at every turn.
